# email-skeleton-generator
A generator to quickly create a basic email template.


This generator allows you to start from a clean email skeleton. You have the option to add:
- the base code needed for darkmode (meta, media queries and code [data-ogsc]
- an up-to-date css reset for links from [Jay Oram's page](https://github.com/JayOram/email-css-resets/blob/main/css-link-resets.md)

Input fields are used to define a title, a preheader, the language, a background color.

A selection field allows you to select the clients and messaging platforms for which CSS targeting is possible. The information is pulled from the website [howtotargetemail](https://www.howtotarget.email/): _a collection of participatory email development techniques to distinguish customers and email platforms based on Mark Robbins' research._
