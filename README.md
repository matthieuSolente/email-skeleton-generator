# Email Skeleton Generator
A generator to quickly create a basic email template.


This generator allows you to start from a clean email skeleton. You have the option to add:
- the base code needed for darkmode (meta, media queries and code [data-ogsc]
- an up-to-date css reset for links from [Jay Oram's page](https://github.com/JayOram/email-css-resets/blob/main/css-link-resets.md)
- a css snippet to show/hide content

You also have the option to: 

- define the title
- define the preheader text
- define the language of the document (repeated on html tag and wrapping div)
- define the general width of the template
- define the template background color (repeated in three place (body, wrapping div and wrapping table for Outlook) and the content area background color as well.


A selection field allows you to select the clients and messaging platforms for which CSS targeting is possible. The information is pulled from the website [howtotargetemail](https://www.howtotarget.email/): _a collection of participatory email development techniques to distinguish customers and email platforms based on Mark Robbins' research._

In the structure panel, you can create the structure of your email : one to four columns with two options for the four columns :50% or 100% width columns on mobile.

Once edited, you just need to add content!
